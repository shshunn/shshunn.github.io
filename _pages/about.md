My name is Shun Wang, a dedicated Financial Engineering graduate from Cornell University, with hands-on experience in quantitative research and financial analysis. I am deeply interested in leveraging statistical methodologies and machine learning techniques, which I've honed through diverse internships and projects, from analyzing stock market performance to predicting air quality in urban settings.

Beyond my professional pursuits, I am passionate about more than just numbers. An avid basketball enthusiast, I find joy and camaraderie in the fast-paced, strategic game. Alongside my love for basketball, I prioritize maintaining a healthy lifestyle by regularly incorporating workouts into my routine.
